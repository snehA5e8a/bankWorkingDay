A simple tool to calculate working days between dates, considering Indian holidays. In dev speak, you might know this as a "Bizdays Calculator" üóìÔ∏è

## Features
- Upload Excel with dates, get working days calculated
- Handles weekends, public holidays, and festival days

```bash
# Setup
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run

```

### What your Excel file should look like

Keep it simple - just two columns:
- `Start_Date`: When your period starts
- `End_Date`: When it ends

| Start_Date | End_Date   |
|------------|------------|
| 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-31 |

If the dates look weird:
- Make sure they're actual Excel dates
- Avoid dates written as plain text
